        <p id="tribute-info">A Brazilian footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.<br> In his prime, he was
            known for his passing, goalscoring, and dribbling. <br> Kaká was widely regarded as one of the greatest
            players of his generation</p>

        <div class="news1">
            <h2>Ricardo Kaka: Modern Icon</h2>
            <p class="text">Breathtaking pace, unthinkable amounts of energy, eye for goal, impeccable
                technique...the list goes of
                his talents goes on and it wasn't long before he was adored by the Rossoneri faithful. While his impact
                for AC Milan has been overwhelming at times, his performances for Brazil have also seen him become
                somewhat of an idol for millions worldwide.

                It is easy to suddenly admire a footballer for his talents and achievements within the game, but
                something that Kaka possesses in contrast to so many players is his contribution to society. The
                Brazilian maestro is a strong Christian and this has a significant influence on his lifestyle and more
                evidently his trademark goal celebration in which he points to the heavens.

                A marvellous act of his unselfish nature is exemplified in his funding of a church in his hometown of
                Brasilia with his earnings. This incredible gesture of kindness will rarely be seen in the modern way of
                life but this incredibly gifted and honest individual continues to outshine many, whether it be on the
                football pitch or in the community. A man who is known to stay true to his word, and is never seen
                making the headlines for the wrong reasons, can we really question his value?

                The heart and soul of AC Milan's team and spirit, despite having departed the Black and Red side of
                Milan, will never be forgotten and AC Milan are a club which will always stay in his heart. Fond
                memories of him are felt by the club and their supporters, with a club statement reading: "AC Milan
                thank the man and the great champion Kaka for his decisive contribution to the many victories achieved
                in the six years of his commitment." Whereas many clubs could have held grudges against their talismanic
                figure leaving for another side, Kaka received a warm and emotional farewell which he thoroughly
                deserved.</p>

            <h3>Milan, Manchester, Barcelona: How Kaka Won the 2007 Ballon d'Or Ahead of Ronaldo</h3>
            <p class="text">Kaka was crowned Ballon d'Or winner in December 2007, picking up almost twice the votes
                Ronaldo received
                in second place. Messi was a distant third. Kaka became the fourth Brazilian to win the award following
                Ronaldo (1997 and 2002), Rivaldo (1999) and Ronaldinho (2004 and 2005). They have competing merits.

                "The original Ronaldo, his career will always come with an asterisk because of his knee injury,"
                Marcotti says. "Before it happened, he was unstoppable. I think he's a notch above the other guys. What
                I love about Rivaldo is that his career path is so different from the other guys. For me, he always has
                a special place because he is somebody who was not appreciated the way he should have been—even in
                Brazil.

                "Was he on a par with Kaka? I don't know. It's very close between those two. Ronaldinho is another whose
                career nosedived early, although he'll be the first to admit it had to do with his partying."

                Kaka's career went downhill after he left Milan in 2009. He spent four seasons at Real Madrid. Like the
                Brazilian Ronaldo, a knee injury did for Kaka. His left knee was operated on a couple of times, the
                second time in a Belgian clinic in August 2010 by Dr Marc Martens after that summer's World Cup.

                Dr Leite was invited two or three times by the medical staff at Real Madrid to restore Kaka to his
                former glories, but it was to no avail.

                "Kaka's big problem was his knee injury," Dr Leite says. "He underwent surgery, but when he returned to
                play, he was not 100 per cent. This was the starting point of many other problems that he had. The hip
                problem that he had was a consequence of the knee problem. This impaired him.

                "He couldn't reach 100 per cent fitness during two or three years exactly at the moment he was at the
                peak of his career. I really believe that if he didn't have this problem, he had everything to continue
                to be the world's No. 1 player for another three or four years." Instead that mantle passed to Ronaldo
                and Messi, who, incredibly, have shared the Ballon d'Or award for the past 10 years. When Ronaldo was
                presented with his fifth award in Paris on Dec. 7, Kaka got a laugh at the ceremony with his take on the
                torch that has been passed: "This year is 10 years since I won the Ballon d'Or, and every time Cristiano
                or Messi wins, it's good for me because everyone remembers mine."</p>
